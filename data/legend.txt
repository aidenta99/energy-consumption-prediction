============ System Variables ============

Sample Time 1
Date time recording the moment of measurement for all measurements in the
HVAC system. All weather data is sampled once per hour, so contain repetition.

TIN
Temperature input, the temperature of the air that will be distributed
amongst the rooms of the building, keeping the temperature in the building
constant.

TRE
Temperature return, the temperature of air flowing out of the
building, maintenance workers often use this measure as the average temperature
in the building.

MRE
This variable represents the humidity level of the air after it has passed
through the heat wheel, but before it has been through the heating or cooling
system.

MME
Represents the humidity level of air leaving the building, used to measure the
average humidity level of the building.

Energy Consumption
Energy consumption in the given time period

============ Weather Variables ============

DD
Wind, in degrees. (360 == north, 90 == east, 180 == south, 270 == west, 0== no
wind, 990 == variable)

FH
Average windspeed in the last hour (measured in 0.1 m/s).

FF
Average windspeed over the past ten minutes (measured in 0.1 m/s).

FX
strongest gust of the past hour (measured in 0.1 m/s).

T
Temperature at 1.5m above ground (measured in 0.1° C).

TD
Dew point temperature at 1.5m above ground (measured in 0.1° C).

SQ
Duration of sunshine, calculated by overall radiation (measured in 0.1 hours).

Q
Overall radiation per hour (measured in J/cm2).

DR
Duration of precipitation (measured in 0.1 hours).

RH
Total amount of precipitation (measured in 0.1 mm, -1 for values <0.05 mm).

P
Air pressure, calculated relative to sea-level (measured in 0.1hPa).

N
Overcast (9 == sky invisible, becoming less cloudy, with 0 being a clear sky).

U
Relative humidity at 1.5m above ground (measure in percentages).
